# Simple Python To-Do List Manager

A command-line based To-Do List manager implemented in Python. This project serves as a learning exercise for basic Python programming concepts including functions, lists, user input handling, and basic error management.

## Features

- Add new tasks to your list
- View all current tasks
- Remove tasks by number
- Simple command-line interface
- Input validation and error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-manager.git
cd todo-list-manager
```

2. Run the program:
```bash
python todo_list.py
```

## Usage

The program presents a menu with 4 options:

1. **Add Task**: Enter a new task to add to your list
2. **View Tasks**: Display all current tasks with numbers
3. **Remove Task**: Remove a task by entering its number
4. **Quit**: Exit the program

## Code Structure

- `show_menu()`: Displays the main menu options
- `add_task(tasks)`: Adds a new task to the list
- `view_tasks(tasks)`: Displays all current tasks
- `remove_task(tasks)`: Removes a specified task
- `main()`: Main program loop and menu handling

## Learning Points

This project demonstrates:
- Working with lists in Python
- Function definitions and parameters
- User input handling
- Basic error handling with try/except
- Type hints for better code clarity
- Menu-driven program structure

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements could include:
- Saving tasks to a file
- Task categories or priorities
- Due dates for tasks
- Task editing functionality
- Task completion status
